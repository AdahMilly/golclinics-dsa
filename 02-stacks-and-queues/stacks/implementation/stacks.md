# Stack Data Structure

`A Program` = `Algorithm` + `Data Structure`

- A program exists to solve a particular `computable` problem. 
- Every program takes in an `input`, `represents/stores` the input into the computer memory(Data Structure), `processes` the input (Algorithm) and produces an `output`
- The way data of particular program is represented and structured dictates the way the program will process the data(Algorithm) : `Data Representation`(Data Structure) dictates `Data Processing` (Algorithm)

## Data Structure
- A data structure consits of two components:
    - How to organise/represent data in the computer memory (Data Structure Representation)
    - How to operate on the data (Data Structure operations)

## Stack Data Structure
A stack is a `Last In First Out` (LIFO) data structure. `Last` item to be added is the `First` item to be retrieved.

### Stack Operations

[Stack Operations](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*MeiRO3bklQkVcGajH1bJWQ.jpeg)
- `push` - Add an item to the top of stack 
- `pop` - Remove an item from the top of the stack and return the item
- `peek` - Retrieve an item from the top of the stack without removing it
- `isEmpty` - Check if the stack is empty
- `size` - Return the number of items on the stack

### Stack Representation
- Stack can represented and implemented using other data structures:
  - Arrays
  - LinkedList
